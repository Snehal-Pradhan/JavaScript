getElementByID("")
getElementByclassName("")  // class => className
.getAttribute("")
.setAttribute("") => makes changes in attributes
title.innerText => shows the visible textContent
// if a tag has display none it will not be seen in innerText but will be available in textContent
title.innerHTML => shows html tags in the tag also
title.textContent => explained above

document.getElementByclassName("")=> may give a list of getElementByclassName
- these elements are not in an array => they are in a HTMLCollections which is slightl different from an array


document.querySelector("h1") => provides first h1 tag

document.querySelectorAll("h2") => provides a nodelist => not an array
for it for each is available but map is mot available


use prototype for all the functions you can perform.


nodelist[2] => using index can be used . not exactly an array . but has a lot of properties similar to an array.



.forEach can be used on a nodelist to change element properties.
to use map => change nodelist to an array.


Array.from.(.....nodelist or ...HTMLCollections) => convert it into an array.


later can use map and forEach.
